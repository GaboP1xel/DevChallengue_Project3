# DevChallengue_Project3
project3 c:
well, third project tan I made, although I'm doing this projects from devChallengues, I'm progressing, litle, but something

this project is about a player music, is only 2 songs from devChallengues, with buttons to play, go back and forward, also has a progress bar that is able to drag to update the time of the song, so it also shows the currentTime (jaja joke) of the song, as the total duration of this, the design is also responsive (idk if is 100% but some is it).
